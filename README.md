# Predicting-Hospital-Readmissions-using-MIMIC-III-and-Diabetes-Data-
 Project Overview:  The goal of this project is to analyze hospital readmissions and patient outcomes by combining two  datasets:  
 ● Diabetes130-US hospitals dataset (readmissions data).  
 ● MIMIC-III Clinical Database (ICU data).
  Project Workflow:
 Task 1: Merging and Analyzing the Data
 1. DataCollection and Cleaning:
 o Prepareandclean data from both the Diabetes 130-US hospitals and MIMIC-III ICU
 datasets. Handle missing values, standardize formats, and ensure consistency across
 variables.
 o Extract key features from the ICU data (e.g., lab results, diagnoses, vital signs,
 medications), and combine it with the diabetes dataset based on relevant patient
 details.
 2. Exploratory Analysis:
 o Analyzepatient demographics (age, gender, race) and clinical features (ICU stay length,
 number of diagnoses, lab results). Investigate how these variables relate to patient
 outcomes such as readmission.
 o Createinitial summary statistics for key variables to understand data distributions and
 potential trends.
 3. DataVisualization:
 o Createvisualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to represent the
 distribution of key variables (e.g., ICU length of stay, number of lab procedures,
 readmission rate).
Task 2: Investigating Patterns and Relationships
 1. Exploring Variable Relationships:
 o Investigate how different patient-level features, such as the number of medications,
 number of lab procedures, and ICU stay length, are associated with readmission
 outcomes.
 o Explorepotential differences in outcomes based on patient characteristics, including
 age, gender, and diagnosis type.
 2. Checking Group Differences:
 o Analyzewhether different groups (e.g., age groups, medication categories, lab test
 counts) have significant differences in patient outcomes (e.g., readmission rates or
 length of stay).
 o Assesshowclinical features (e.g., treatments, medications) differ among patients with
 different readmission outcomes.
 3. Exploring Distributions:
 o Studythedistribution of patient outcomes and clinical features (e.g., number of
 medications or lab results) to identify trends across different groups of patients.
 o Identify patterns that could indicate potential risk factors for patient readmission or
 longer hospital stays.
 Task 3: Predicting Patient Outcomes
 1. Modeling the Data:
 o Buildamodeltopredict the likelihood of patient readmission based on the combined
 datasets. Use patient demographics and clinical data such as vital signs, lab procedures,
 and ICU stay information to predict outcomes.
 o Evaluate the model's performance using standard metrics and identify key factors
 influencing predictions.
 2. Segmenting Patients:
 o Grouppatients into different segments based on their clinical data (e.g., number of
 medications, number of lab tests, ICU stay length). Use this segmentation to identify
 high-risk patient groups.
 o Analyzewhichpatient segments are more likely to have specific outcomes such as
 readmission or extended ICU stays.
 3. Evaluating Outcomes:
 o Assessthepredictive power of the model by checking how well it identifies high-risk
 patients.
o Identify the most important features that drive the model's performance and provide
 insights into which clinical factors have the most significant impact on patient outcomes.
